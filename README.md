# toDoApp
A lightweight RestApi built with Express, Typscript and Mongoose.
## Notes
I don't usually push node_modules, /config or .env but for the sake of this project to be easilly tested I did.
### Prerequisites

You need to have MongoDB installed and mongod service up and runing.
You can change the authentication data in the .env file for the MongoDB.
```
user='YOUR_USERNAME'
pass='YOUR_PASSWORD'
dbName='toDoApp' // DB NAME
```
